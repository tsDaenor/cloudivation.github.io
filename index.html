				<h2>my <strong>Vision</strong>?</h2>
				<p>A lot of companies are currently planning to, or even in the process of migrating to the cloud. At first glance this seems like an easy process that will solve a lot of problems. Easier management of infrastructure, faster deployments, less operational overhead. Goals that every IT business strives for.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, the reality is far from this. After the implementation of a “lift and shift” scenario it only results in a relocation of problems, creating identical complications in the cloud environment. The cloud facilitates resolving these difficulties but will not provide you with a ready-to-go solution. Unlocking its full potential requires a cloud transformation rather than a migration.</p>

				<p>I am convinced that every company has the potential to benefit from a move towards a cloud environment. My expertise, accumulated from multiple projects throughout my career as a cloud engineer, provides a unique advantage of an effortless cloud migration, while shielding you from its common pitfalls. I provide assistance in translating your current environment into infrastructure as code. Furthermore, the deployment pipelines will be optimized, where needed, to smoothen the transition into Continuous integration or even Continuous deployment. However, to successfully unlock the full potential of the cloud your teams need to be equipped with the correct mindset and tools. Ultimately, my goal is to provide those tools required, thereby enhancing their problem-solving capabilities while reducing the overhead workload, resulting in a better team dynamic and with greater performance.</p>

				<p>Moving your IT infrastructure to the cloud can be a challenging process, but it does not have to be. With the right people and attitude, it will be the transformation that will elevate your future successes.</p>
